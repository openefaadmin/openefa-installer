## Recent Session Summary (October 20, 2025)

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes and Template Regressions (v1.5.6)

#### Release v1.5.6: Complete Bug Fix Release
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Pushed to GitHub
**Version:** 1.5.6
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Multiple Bug Fixes
**Commit:** b6d2d02

**Problems Discovered:**
1. User edit form wouldn't submit - "Update User" button inactive
2. V1.5.4 introduced template regressions - backup download broken
3. Config file permission errors preventing backups
4. Bootstrap script couldn't read keyboard input when piped from curl
5. Non-functional Authentication card in config dashboard

---

#### Bug Fix #1: User Edit Form Submission Issue
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Priority:** HIGH - Admin Functionality Broken

**Problem:**
- User edit form "Update User" button wouldn't activate
- Console error: "An invalid form control with name='' is not focusable"
- Couldn't update user first name, last name, company name, roles, or domains

**Root Cause:**
- Hidden "Add New Alias" email field had `required` attribute (line 169)
- HTML5 validation blocks form submission when it can't focus hidden required fields
- JavaScript validation runs when adding aliases, but broke main form update

**Fix:**
- Removed `required` attribute from hidden alias email field
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/admin/edit_user.html` line 169
- Validation still works when actually adding aliases (JavaScript handles it)

**Testing:**
- ✅ User confirmed: "That worked."
- ✅ Can now update user information
- ✅ Can change roles and domain assignments

**Files Modified:**
- Production: `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/admin/edit_user.html`
- Installer: `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/admin/edit_user.html`
- Committed: 6363862

---

#### Enhancement #1: Bootstrap Script with Update Detection
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** HIGH - User Experience Improvement

**Problem:**
- Users had separate install.sh and update.sh commands
- Confusing for users to know which to use
- No detection of existing installations

**Solution:**
- Created intelligent `bootstrap.sh` that detects existing installations
- Single command for both install and update: `curl -sSL http://install.openefa.com/install.sh | sudo bash`
- Menu-driven interface when existing installation detected

**Features:**
1. **Installation Detection:**
   - Checks for `/opt/spacyserver` directory
   - Reads VERSION file to show current version
   - Presents menu: Update / Reinstall / Cancel

2. **stdin/tty Handling:**
   - Reads from `/dev/tty` when piped from curl
   - Allows keyboard input even when stdin is redirected
   - Fixed issue where script would exit after showing menu

3. **Apache Redirects:**
   - Configured on 192.168.50.56 (install.openefa.com)
   - All three URLs redirect to bootstrap.sh:
     - `/install.sh` → bootstrap.sh
     - `/update.sh` → bootstrap.sh
     - `/bootstrap.sh` → bootstrap.sh

**Files Created:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/bootstrap.sh` (146 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `/var/www/openefa/install/.htaccess` on 192.168.50.56

**Testing:**
- ✅ User tested: "That is perfect. I ran 1.5.3 and then ran the update script. it worked. I then ran the update script again and it checked, and said i don't need to update"

**Commits:**
- 5541ad1 - Bootstrap script with update detection
- 535db9e - Fixed stdin/tty handling

---

#### Bug Fix #2: Template Regressions from v1.5.4
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Broken Functionality

**Problem:**
- User: "bug after bug.. cricky, getting frustrated"
- Backup management page lost download-to-desktop functionality
- Cleanup settings error: "Table 'spacy_email_db.system_settings' doesn't exist"
- V1.5.4 installer accidentally included older template versions (Oct 19 02:xx)
- Updates overwrote working templates with broken versions (Oct 19 18:12)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Backup Management Template:**
   - Installer had 19,580 byte version (old) from Oct 19 02:32
   - Production had 14,507 byte version initially (broken - no download)
   - Working version was 19,580 bytes with auto-download functionality
   - Older backups showed working version existed but was lost

2. **Template Comparison:**
   - Found 5 templates with regressions:
     - `backup_management.html` - Missing auto-download feature
     - `base.html` - 13,325 → 13,510 bytes
     - `email_detail.html` - 40,716 → 37,877 bytes
     - `emails.html` - 34,478 → 32,605 bytes
     - `quarantine_detail.html` - 16,036 → 13,461 bytes

3. **Backup Auto-Download Feature:**
   - Old working version (19,580 bytes) had:
     - "Download Database Backup" and "Download Full System Backup" button labels
     - Backup option checkboxes (email attachments, config files, web application)
     - Auto-download functionality: `window.location.href = /api/backup/download/${filename}`
   - After creating backup, automatically triggers download to desktop
   - Modern version (14,507 bytes) removed all this functionality

**Fix Applied:**
- Restored `backup_management.html` from Oct 19 backup (19,580 bytes)
- Copied to both production and installer
- Restarted SpacyWeb service

**Backup Management Features Restored:**
1. **Database Backup Options:**
   - Checkbox: Include email attachments
   - Button: "Download Database Backup"
   - Auto-download after creation

2. **Full System Backup Options:**
   - Checkbox: Database (always included, disabled)
   - Checkbox: Configuration files
   - Checkbox: Web application
   - Checkbox: Email attachments
   - Button: "Download Full System Backup"
   - Auto-download after creation

3. **JavaScript Auto-Download:**
```javascript
if (data.filename) {
    window.location.href = `/api/backup/download/${filename}`;
}
```

**Files Restored:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/backup_management.html` (19,580 bytes)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/backup_management.html`

---

#### Bug Fix #3: Config File Permission Errors
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Priority:** HIGH - Backup Failures

**Problem:**
- Full system backup failed with error:
  - "Full backup failed: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/opt/spacyserver/config/module_config.json'"
- Some config files owned by root:root instead of spacy-filter:spacy-filter
- Web application runs as spacy-filter user but couldn't read root-owned files

**Root Cause:**
- `module_config.json` was root:root with 600 permissions
- SpacyWeb service (running as spacy-filter) couldn't read it during backup
- tar command in full backup process hit permission denied error

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Immediate Fix (Production):**
```bash
sudo chown spacy-filter:spacy-filter /opt/spacyserver/config/module_config.json
sudo chmod 640 /opt/spacyserver/config/module_config.json
```

2. **Installer Fix:**
- Created `fix_config_permissions()` function in `lib/services.sh` (lines 205-243)
- Automatically fixes ownership and permissions for all config files:
  - JSON config files: spacy-filter:spacy-filter with 640 permissions
  - .my.cnf (database credentials): spacy-filter:spacy-filter with 600 permissions
  - modules.ini: spacy-filter:spacy-filter with 600 permissions
  - .app_config.ini: spacy-filter:spacy-filter with 640 permissions
- Function runs automatically during installation (line 260)
- Uses `find` command to catch all JSON files

**Function Details:**
```bash
fix_config_permissions() {
    info "Fixing all config file permissions..."
    local install_dir="/opt/spacyserver"

    # Ensure config directory exists with correct permissions
    mkdir -p "${install_dir}/config"
    chown spacy-filter:spacy-filter "${install_dir}/config"
    chmod 750 "${install_dir}/config"

    # Fix all JSON config files
    find "${install_dir}/config" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "*.json" -exec chown spacy-filter:spacy-filter {} \;
    find "${install_dir}/config" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "*.json" -exec chmod 640 {} \;

    # Fix credentials files
    # .my.cnf, modules.ini (600), .app_config.ini (640)
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/services.sh` - Added fix_config_permissions() function and call

**Testing:**
- ✅ Full system backup now works without permission errors
- ✅ Backup downloads to desktop automatically

---

#### Bug Fix #4: Removed Non-Functional Authentication Card
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Priority:** MEDIUM - UX Improvement

**Problem:**
- Configuration dashboard had "Authentication" card
- Card linked to `/config/authentication` route
- Route was never implemented - clicking resulted in 404 error
- Confusing user experience with broken link

**Investigation:**
- Checked all 8 config cards on dashboard
- Only `/config/authentication` route missing
- Config file `authentication_config.json` exists and is used by email filter
- Contains SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification settings
- Settings are advanced and rarely changed

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed Authentication card from `config_dashboard.html`
- Config file still exists and is actively used by email filter
- System admins can edit the JSON file directly if needed

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/config_dashboard.html`
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/config_dashboard.html`
- Committed: 1fb5a31

---

#### Bug Fix #5: System Settings Table (v1.5.4 Issue)
**Status:** ✅ Documented Workaround
**Priority:** HIGH - Upgrade Issue

**Problem:**
- V1.5.4 upgrades show error: "Table 'spacy_email_db.system_settings' doesn't exist"
- Cleanup settings page fails to load
- Email cleanup feature broken

**Root Cause:**
- Table IS in SQL schema for fresh installs (works correctly)
- Upgrades from v1.5.3 don't have migration script to create table
- Only affects existing installations upgrading to v1.5.4+

**Workaround Provided:**
- SQL script provided in CHANGES_v1.5.6.md
- Users can manually create table:
```sql
mysql -u root -p spacy_email_db <<'EOF'
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `system_settings` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `setting_key` varchar(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  `setting_value` text NOT NULL,
  ...
);
INSERT INTO system_settings (setting_key, setting_value, description, updated_by) VALUES
('cleanup_expired_emails_enabled', 'true', 'Enable automatic cleanup of expired quarantine emails', 'system'),
('cleanup_retention_days', '30', 'Number of days to retain emails before cleanup', 'system'),
('prevent_spam_release', 'false', 'Prevent releasing emails marked as spam (spam_score >= 5.0)', 'system')
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE setting_value = VALUES(setting_value);
EOF
```

**Future Fix:**
- Need migration script system for schema changes
- Add to future release

---

#### Version Release Process

- Fixed template regressions
- Created CHANGES_v1.5.5.md
- Pushed to GitHub: commit 70f80c6

**Issue Discovered:**
- User ran update on dev server - said "no update needed"
- Multiple commits made AFTER v1.5.5 tag:
  - Backup auto-download fix
  - Config permissions fix
  - Authentication card removal
- Update script compares VERSION file (1.5.5 == 1.5.5, no update)

**Decision:**
- Bump to v1.5.6 to trigger update detection

## Recent Session Summary (October 18, 2025 - Evening)

### 🤖 AI Summary Enhancement & Generic Release Messages (PENDING TESTING)

#### Major AI Summary Rewrite
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Awaiting Testing
**Version:** Pending (for v1.5.3 or v1.6.0)
**Priority:** HIGH - Feature Enhancement

**Problem:** AI Summary feature was only displaying email subject lines, never actually analyzing the email body content. For a 4000-word story email, the summary would just show "Matt's Cat of Kolob Ridge" (the subject) instead of summarizing the story content.

**Root Cause:**
- `generate_content_summary()` in `entity_extraction.py` had a critical flaw at lines 164-168
- Function checked if subject existed and immediately returned it
- Body content analysis code existed but was never reached
- Function short-circuited before any NLP analysis could run

**Solution Implemented:**

**Complete Redesign of `generate_content_summary()` function:**

1. **Removed Subject-Line Shortcut:**
   - Deleted lines 164-168 that always returned subject
   - Now subject is only used as context for very long emails (400+ words)

2. **Full Body Content Analysis:**
   - Processes up to 50,000 characters (handles 4000+ word emails)
   - Uses spaCy NLP for sentence segmentation
   - Filters out greetings, signatures, boilerplate text

3. **Intelligent Sentence Scoring System:**
   - **Named Entity Score:** +2 points per entity (people, organizations, dates, money)
   - **Content Score:** +1 point per key noun or verb
   - **Fact Score:** +5 bonus for dates, money, numbers, percentages
   - **Position Score:** +3 to +9 bonus for first 3 sentences (often most important)
   - **Readability Penalty:** -2 points for overly long sentences (>200 chars)

4. **Dynamic Summary Length Scaling:**
   - **Short emails (<100 words):** 1 sentence summary (max 300 chars)
   - **Medium emails (100-400 words):** 2 sentences (max 500 chars)
   - **Long emails (400-1000 words):** 3 sentences (max 500 chars)
   - **Very long emails (1000+ words):** 4-5 sentences (max 750 chars)

5. **Smart Filtering:**
   - Skips: "dear", "hi", "hello", "thanks", "best regards", "sincerely"
   - Removes: email headers, unsubscribe links, privacy policy text
   - Ignores: very short sentences (<30 chars), name-only sentences

**Testing Example - Matt's Cat Story:**
- **Input:** 390-word story about a cat named Ridge on Kolob mountain
- **Old Output:** `Matt's Cat of Kolob Ridge` (just subject, 26 chars)
- **New Output:** `They first saw him in the fall, just before the snow started to flirt with the ridgelines — a small gray cat padding through the sagebrush like a shadow that had decided to stay. Every evening, when the light softens and the deer wander out to feed, Ridge curls up on the porch beside Matt — two creatures who chose the mountain life and learned how to endure it.` (303 chars, 2 sentences)

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/modules/entity_extraction.py` - Lines 157-287 (complete rewrite)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/modules/entity_extraction.py` - Updated to match

**Critical Fix - File Permissions:**
- Issue discovered: `entity_extraction.py` ownership changed to `root:root` after edit
- Prevented `spacy-filter` user from importing module
- All AI features (summaries, entities, topics) failed silently
- **Fixed:** Changed ownership to `spacy-filter:spacy-filter`
- Installer automatically sets correct permissions during installation

**Impact:**
- ✅ AI summaries now analyze actual email content
- ✅ Multi-sentence summaries for longer emails
- ✅ Intelligent NLP-based key point extraction
- ✅ Scales appropriately to email length
- ✅ No configuration changes required

---

#### Generic Release Messages
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Awaiting Testing
**Priority:** LOW - UX Improvement

**Problem:** Release success messages said "Email released and sent to mailguard" which is system-specific and confusing for other administrators who may not be using MailGuard.

**Solution:**
- Changed message from: `f'Email released and sent to {mode}'`
- To: `'Email released and delivered successfully'`
- Generic message works for any relay configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py` - Line 5031
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/quarantine_routes.py` - Line 328
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - Updated
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/quarantine_routes.py` - Updated

**Testing Required:**
- [ ] Release single email and verify message
- [ ] Bulk release and verify message
- [ ] Verify email actually delivers

---

#### Security Verification - Sensitive Data
**Status:** ✅ Verified Clean

**Checked for in Installer:**
- ❌ Phone number `17025618743` - Not found
- ❌ Phone formats `702-561-8743`, `+17025618743` - Not found
- ❌ ClickSend credentials - Not found
- ❌ ClickSend API keys - Not found
- ❌ `notification_config.json` - Not in installer (server-only)

**Result:** All personal credentials and phone numbers are server-specific and NOT included in installer files.

---

**File:** `/opt/openefa-installer/PENDING_CHANGES.md`

**Purpose:** Track changes awaiting testing before GitHub push

**Contents:**
1. Detailed description of AI Summary improvements
2. Detailed description of generic release messages
3. Testing checklists for both features
4. Installation notes
5. Rollback plan

## Recent Session Summary (October 18, 2025 - Afternoon)

### 🔧 Installation Fix: Cleanup Script Deployment (v1.5.2)

#### Installation Completeness Fix
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** 1.5.2
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Installation Bug Fix

**Problem:** During dev server installation verification, discovered that `cleanup_expired_emails.py` was not being deployed during installation, and no cron job was configured to run it.

**Root Cause:**
- Installer had no code to copy cleanup script from `openefa-files/` to `/opt/spacyserver/`
- No cron job setup despite database having cleanup enabled (`cleanup_expired_emails_enabled: true`)
- Inconsistency: cleanup settings in database but script not available

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Package Dependencies** (`lib/packages.sh` line 47):
   - Added `cron` to core system packages
   - Ensures cron is installed on minimal Ubuntu installations
   - Dev testing revealed cron was missing on minimal installations

2. **File Deployment** (`lib/modules.sh` lines 43-49):
   - Added cleanup script copy to `copy_module_files()` function
   - Script deployed to `/opt/spacyserver/cleanup_expired_emails.py`
   - Permissions: 755, Owner: spacy-filter:spacy-filter

3. **Cron Job Setup** (`lib/services.sh` lines 147-175):
   - Created new `setup_cleanup_cron()` function
   - Configures daily cron job at 2:00 AM
   - Command: `/opt/spacyserver/venv/bin/python3 /opt/spacyserver/cleanup_expired_emails.py`
   - Output logged to `/opt/spacyserver/logs/cleanup.log`

4. **Integration** (`lib/services.sh` line 190):
   - Added `setup_cleanup_cron()` call to `setup_services()` function
   - Cron setup now runs automatically during installation

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check script exists
ls -lh /opt/spacyserver/cleanup_expired_emails.py

# Check cron job
sudo crontab -u spacy-filter -l | grep cleanup

# Check database settings
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT setting_key, setting_value FROM spacy_email_db.system_settings WHERE setting_key LIKE 'cleanup%';"
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Fresh installations now have complete cleanup system
- ✅ Cleanup script properly deployed with correct permissions
- ✅ Cron job automatically configured during installation
- ✅ Email retention system fully operational out-of-box

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/packages.sh` - Added cron to core packages
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/modules.sh` - Added cleanup script deployment
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/services.sh` - Added cron job setup function
- `/opt/openefa-installer/VERSION` - Bumped to 1.5.2
- `/opt/openefa-installer/CHANGES_v1.5.2.md` - Documentation

### 🛡️ ClamAV Antivirus Integration (v1.5.1)

#### Critical Security Enhancement: Email Virus Scanning
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** 1.5.1
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Security Feature

**Problem:** ClamAV daemon was running but emails were NOT being scanned for viruses despite the antivirus_scanner module existing.

**Root Cause:**
- Antivirus scanner module was registered but never invoked in email processing pipeline
- No integration point in analyze_email_with_modules() function

**Fix Applied:**
- Integrated antivirus_scanner into email processing pipeline (email_filter.py lines 1673-1710)
- All email attachments now scanned by ClamAV before delivery
- Virus detection adds +20 spam points and quarantines email
- Headers added: X-Virus-Detected, X-Virus-Names

**Testing:**
- Email ID 149544: Clean email (no attachment) ✅
- Email ID 149545: PDF attachment scanned successfully ✅
- Module execution confirmed in X-Analysis-Modules header ✅

**Impact:**
- ✅ All incoming emails now scanned for viruses
- ✅ Attachments checked against 27,796 virus signatures
- ✅ Infected emails automatically quarantined
- ✅ Critical security gap closed

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/email_filter.py` - Added antivirus integration (38 lines)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/email_filter.py` - Updated
- `/opt/openefa-installer/VERSION` - Bumped to 1.5.1

## Recent Session Summary (October 18, 2025)

### 📊 Spam Score Header Enhancements & Bug Fixes (v1.5.0)

#### Critical Bug Fix: Spam Headers Not Stored in Database
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Version:** 1.5.0
**Severity:** HIGH

**Problem:** Comprehensive spam score headers (X-Spam-Score-Total, X-Spam-Score-Breakdown, etc.) were being added to emails but NOT appearing in the database.

**Root Cause:** Database storage happened BEFORE headers were added.
- Line 2738: `store_email_analysis_via_queue()` called (email stored WITHOUT headers)
- Line 2747: Headers added AFTER storage (too late!)

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved database storage call from line 2738 to line 2827 (AFTER all headers are added)
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/email_filter.py`
- Now all spam score headers are properly stored in raw_email field

**Testing:**
- Email ID 149528: Score 0.5 → `X-Spam-Score-Total: 0.5` ✅ stored
- Email ID 149529: Score 8.0 → `X-Spam-Score-Total: 8.0` ✅ stored
- Email ID 149530: Score 6.0 → `X-Spam-Score-Total: 6.0` ✅ stored

#### Header Cleanup: Removed Duplicate Spam Score Header
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Two headers showing the same total spam score:
- `X-SpaCy-Spam-Score: 6.0` (legacy)
- `X-Spam-Score-Total: 6.0` (new comprehensive header)

**Decision:** User preferred clarity of `X-Spam-Score-Total`

**Changes:**
- Removed `X-SpaCy-Spam-Score` header (line 2736)
- Kept `X-Spam-Score-Total` as the single source of truth
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/email_filter.py`

**Result:** Clean, non-redundant spam score headers

#### Thread Analysis: Removed Misleading "Disabled" Header
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Problem:** Header showed `X-Thread-Analysis: disabled` even though thread analysis was fully functional.

**Root Cause:** Legacy fallback code (lines 2798-2809) always added "disabled" status for reply emails, even when thread analysis successfully ran.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed misleading code block completely (lines 2798-2809)
- Thread analysis headers now accurately reflect status:
  - `X-Thread-Reply: True/False`
  - `X-Thread-Trust: -2 to 5`
  - `X-Fake-Reply-Detected: true` (when detected)
  - `X-Fake-Reply-Confidence: 0.95` (confidence score)
  - `X-Fake-Reply-Spam-Boost: 9.75` (spam penalty)

**Testing:**
- Email ID 149541: Fake reply detected with 95% confidence, 9.75 spam boost ✅

**Thread Analysis Features (Confirmed Working):**
1. ✅ Thread continuity checking (`check_thread_continuity()`)
2. ✅ Fake reply detection (catches "Re:" emails with no conversation history)
3. ✅ Thread trust scoring (1-5 scale for legitimate threads)
4. ✅ Spam score reduction for legitimate replies (3-10 points)
5. ✅ Spam score boost for fake replies (up to 10 points)

#### Mark as Not Spam Fix (from v1.4.0)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Marking email as "not spam" didn't update red spam indicator in UI.

**Fix:**
- Updated `/api/quarantine/<id>/not-spam` route
- Now reduces spam_score by 5.0 and sets email_category to 'clean'
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py` lines 5361-5371

#### Spam Score Breakdown Display (from v1.4.0)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Features:**
- Added comprehensive spam score breakdown card to email detail page
- Displays all module scores with color-coded risk levels
- Shows X-Spam-Score-Breakdown summary
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/email_detail.html` lines 298-377

**Files Modified (v1.5.0):**
- Production:
  - `/opt/spacyserver/email_filter.py` - Header order fix, duplicate removal, thread header cleanup
  - `/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py` - Mark as not spam fix
  - `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/email_detail.html` - Spam breakdown display
  - `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/config_dashboard.html` - Cleanup card
- Installer:
  - `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/email_filter.py` - All fixes applied
  - `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - All fixes applied

### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Client Role Email Filtering (v1.3.1)

#### Security Vulnerability Patched
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Version:** 1.3.1

**Vulnerability:** Client role users could see ALL emails in their domain instead of only their own emails and managed aliases.

**Issue Details:**
- User reported: joe@openefa.org (client role) with alias contact@openefa.org could see scott@openefa.org's emails
- Root cause: Email filtering logic (lines 797-804 in app.py) filtered all non-admin users by authorized_domains
- This meant CLIENT role users saw the entire domain's emails, not just their own
- This is Priority #12 from the bug list

**Security Fix Applied:**
Modified `/emails` route filtering logic to differentiate between user roles:

**Before:**
```python
if not current_user.is_admin():
    # ALL non-admin users filtered by authorized domains
    authorized_domains = get_user_authorized_domains(current_user)
    # This allowed clients to see ALL domain emails
```

**After:**
```python
if not current_user.is_admin():
    if current_user.role == 'client':
        # CLIENT: Only see emails where they are sender/recipient/alias recipient
        # Query user_managed_aliases table for user's aliases
        # Build WHERE: (sender = user OR recipients LIKE user OR recipients LIKE alias)
    else:
        # DOMAIN_ADMIN: Continue seeing authorized domains
        authorized_domains = get_user_authorized_domains(current_user)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py` (Production) - Lines 796-830
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - Lines 796-830
- `/opt/openefa-installer/VERSION` - Bumped to 1.3.1

**Testing Required:**
- Log in as joe@openefa.org (client role)
- Verify joe ONLY sees:
  - Emails where sender = joe@openefa.org
  - Emails where recipients contains joe@openefa.org
  - Emails where recipients contains contact@openefa.org (joe's alias)
- Verify joe CANNOT see scott@openefa.org's emails

**Impact:**
- Critical security vulnerability fixed
- Client users now have proper email isolation
- Domain admins retain full domain visibility
- Super admins retain all email visibility

## Previous Session Summary (October 15, 2025)

### Major Features Implemented

#### 1. Domain Relay Host Management
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Full relay host configuration system for routing emails after processing.

**Components:**
- **Database:** Added `relay_host` column to `client_domains` table
- **Web UI:** Added relay host field to domain add/edit forms in `domain_management.html`
- **Backend:** `update_postfix_transport()` function in `app.py` automatically generates `/etc/postfix/transport`
- **Automation:** Automatic Postfix transport file updates and reload on domain add/edit/delete/toggle operations

**File Locations:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/sql/schema_v1.sql` - Schema with relay_host column
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - update_postfix_transport() function (lines 99-153)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/domain_management.html` - UI for relay host management
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/database.sh` - Insert relay_host when creating initial domains (lines 143-161)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/postfix.sh` - Transport file permissions and sudoers setup (lines 103-105, 285-297)

**How it Works:**
1. User adds/edits domain with relay host IP or hostname in web interface
2. Domain saved to database with relay_host value
3. `update_postfix_transport()` function automatically called
4. Function queries database for all active domains with relay_host
5. Generates `/etc/postfix/transport` file with format: `domain    smtp:[relay_host]`
6. Runs `postmap /etc/postfix/transport` to compile hash database
7. Runs `sudo /usr/sbin/postfix reload` to apply changes (passwordless via sudoers)

**Permissions:**
- Transport file: `spacy-filter:postfix` with mode 660
- Sudoers rule: `/etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix` allows `spacy-filter` to run `postfix reload` without password

**Testing:** ✅ Verified working with curl install on October 15, 2025

---

#### 2. Enhanced Email Viewing (All Emails)
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Complete rewrite of email detail view with headers, authentication data, and management actions.

**Components:**
- **Database Columns Added:**
  - `raw_email` (LONGTEXT) - Complete raw MIME email
  - `original_spf` (VARCHAR 50) - SPF authentication result
  - `original_dkim` (VARCHAR 50) - DKIM authentication result
  - `original_dmarc` (VARCHAR 50) - DMARC authentication result

- **Backend Processing:**
  - `db_processor.py` extracts authentication headers from raw emails using regex
  - Checks both custom `X-SpaCy-Auth-Results` header and standard `Authentication-Results` header
  - Stores in database for display

- **Web Interface:**
  - Collapsible email body section (Bootstrap 5 collapse component)
  - Headers display with "Show Headers" button
  - SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication results in Metadata section
  - Action buttons: Release, Whitelist, Mark as Spam, Delete

**File Locations:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/services/db_processor.py` - Authentication extraction (lines 291-352)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/modules/email_database.py` - SQLAlchemy model with new columns
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - Headers API endpoint (lines 4237-4312)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/email_detail.html` - Complete UI rewrite

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/quarantine/<email_id>/headers` - Returns email headers (checks both email_quarantine and email_analysis tables)
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/release` - Release email to recipient
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/whitelist` - Add sender to whitelist
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/spam` - Mark as spam
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/delete` - Delete email

**Testing:** ✅ Verified working with curl install on October 15, 2025

---

#### 3. Quarantine Brief Content Preview
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Shows 3-5 line preview of email content in User Messages view instead of full content.

**Implementation:**
- Backend parsing in `quarantine_view()` function extracts first 3-5 lines or 250 characters
- Template displays `content_preview` field instead of `text_content`

### Database Schema Updates

**Table: `client_domains`**
```sql
ALTER TABLE client_domains ADD COLUMN relay_host VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL AFTER client_name;
```

**Table: `email_analysis`**
```sql
ALTER TABLE email_analysis ADD COLUMN raw_email LONGTEXT NULL AFTER pii_types;
ALTER TABLE email_analysis ADD COLUMN original_spf VARCHAR(50) NULL AFTER raw_email;
ALTER TABLE email_analysis ADD COLUMN original_dkim VARCHAR(50) NULL AFTER original_spf;
ALTER TABLE email_analysis ADD COLUMN original_dmarc VARCHAR(50) NULL AFTER original_dkim;
```

**Database Privileges:**
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.proc TO 'spacy_user'@'localhost';
```
- Required for database backup functionality (SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE)

---

### Installer Updates

**Files Modified:**
1. `/opt/openefa-installer/sql/schema_v1.sql` - Added all new columns
2. `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/database.sh` - Insert relay_host with initial domains, grant mysql.proc privilege
3. `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/postfix.sh` - Set transport file permissions and sudoers configuration

**Key Installer Changes:**

**database.sh (lines 143-161):**
```bash
# Now includes relay_host in INSERT
INSERT INTO client_domains (domain, client_name, relay_host, active, created_at)
VALUES ('${domain}', '${domain}', '${RELAY_SERVER_IP}', 1, NOW())
```

**postfix.sh (lines 103-105):**
```bash
# Set permissions so spacy-filter can update the transport file
chown spacy-filter:postfix "${transport_file}" "${transport_file}.db"
chmod 660 "${transport_file}" "${transport_file}.db"
```

**postfix.sh (lines 285-297):**
```bash
# Configure sudoers for Postfix reload
cat > /etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix << 'EOSUDO'
# Allow spacy-filter to reload Postfix for transport map updates
spacy-filter ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/postfix reload
EOSUDO
chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix
visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix
```

### Known Issues and Resolutions

**Issue 1: Transport file ownership**
**Problem:** When manually writing transport file as root, ownership changes to root:root, preventing web app from updating it
**Resolution:** Installer sets correct ownership (spacy-filter:postfix 660) and Python preserves it during writes
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue 2: Postfix reload permission denied**
**Problem:** Web app (running as spacy-filter) couldn't reload Postfix
**Resolution:** Added sudoers rule for passwordless `postfix reload` command
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue 3: Database backup privilege error**
**Problem:** SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE failed with insufficient privileges
**Resolution:** Added `GRANT SELECT ON mysql.proc` to installer
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

### File Permissions Reference

**Critical Files:**
```
/etc/postfix/transport        spacy-filter:postfix  660
/etc/postfix/transport.db      spacy-filter:postfix  660
/etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix   root:root             440
/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py    spacy-filter:spacy-filter  640
```

### Architecture Notes

**Email Flow:**
1. Email arrives at Postfix SMTP server
2. Postfix pipes to SpaCy filter (`email_filter.py`)
3. SpaCy filter processes email through modules
4. `db_processor.py` stores in database with headers and authentication data
5. If safe, email queued for delivery
6. Postfix checks transport map for relay host
7. Email delivered to configured relay host

**Transport Map Update Flow:**
1. User modifies domain via web interface (add/edit/delete/toggle)
2. `update_postfix_transport()` function called automatically
3. Function queries database for active domains with relay_host
4. Generates `/etc/postfix/transport` file
5. Runs `postmap` to compile hash database
6. Runs `sudo postfix reload` to apply changes
7. New routing immediately active

### Important Code References

**update_postfix_transport() function** (`app.py` lines 99-153):
```python
def update_postfix_transport():
    """
    Update Postfix transport file from database.
    Reads all active domains with relay_hosts and writes to /etc/postfix/transport
    """
    import subprocess
    transport_file = '/etc/postfix/transport'

    try:
        # Get all active domains with relay hosts from database
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT domain, relay_host
            FROM client_domains
            WHERE active = 1 AND relay_host IS NOT NULL AND relay_host != ''
            ORDER BY domain
        """)

        # Build transport file content
        # Write to file
        # Run postmap
        # Reload Postfix with sudo

        logger.info(f"Updated Postfix transport file with {len(domains)} domains and reloaded Postfix")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to update Postfix transport: {e}")
        return False
```

**Authentication Header Extraction** (`db_processor.py` lines 291-352):
- Parses raw email using `email.message_from_string()`
- Checks custom `X-SpaCy-Auth-Results` header first
- Falls back to standard `Authentication-Results` header
- Uses regex to extract SPF, DKIM, DMARC results
- Handles multiple formats and edge cases
