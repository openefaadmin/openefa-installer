### 🤖 AI Summary Enhancement & Generic Release Messages (PENDING TESTING)

#### Major AI Summary Rewrite
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Awaiting Testing
**Version:** Pending (for v1.5.3 or v1.6.0)
**Priority:** HIGH - Feature Enhancement

**Problem:** AI Summary feature was only displaying email subject lines, never actually analyzing the email body content. For a 4000-word story email, the summary would just show "Matt's Cat of Kolob Ridge" (the subject) instead of summarizing the story content.

**Root Cause:**
- `generate_content_summary()` in `entity_extraction.py` had a critical flaw at lines 164-168
- Function checked if subject existed and immediately returned it
- Body content analysis code existed but was never reached
- Function short-circuited before any NLP analysis could run

**Solution Implemented:**

**Complete Redesign of `generate_content_summary()` function:**

1. **Removed Subject-Line Shortcut:**
   - Deleted lines 164-168 that always returned subject
   - Now subject is only used as context for very long emails (400+ words)

2. **Full Body Content Analysis:**
   - Processes up to 50,000 characters (handles 4000+ word emails)
   - Uses spaCy NLP for sentence segmentation
   - Filters out greetings, signatures, boilerplate text

3. **Intelligent Sentence Scoring System:**
   - **Named Entity Score:** +2 points per entity (people, organizations, dates, money)
   - **Content Score:** +1 point per key noun or verb
   - **Fact Score:** +5 bonus for dates, money, numbers, percentages
   - **Position Score:** +3 to +9 bonus for first 3 sentences (often most important)
   - **Readability Penalty:** -2 points for overly long sentences (>200 chars)

4. **Dynamic Summary Length Scaling:**
   - **Short emails (<100 words):** 1 sentence summary (max 300 chars)
   - **Medium emails (100-400 words):** 2 sentences (max 500 chars)
   - **Long emails (400-1000 words):** 3 sentences (max 500 chars)
   - **Very long emails (1000+ words):** 4-5 sentences (max 750 chars)

5. **Smart Filtering:**
   - Skips: "dear", "hi", "hello", "thanks", "best regards", "sincerely"
   - Removes: email headers, unsubscribe links, privacy policy text
   - Ignores: very short sentences (<30 chars), name-only sentences

**Testing Example - Matt's Cat Story:**
- **Input:** 390-word story about a cat named Ridge on Kolob mountain
- **Old Output:** `Matt's Cat of Kolob Ridge` (just subject, 26 chars)
- **New Output:** `They first saw him in the fall, just before the snow started to flirt with the ridgelines — a small gray cat padding through the sagebrush like a shadow that had decided to stay. Every evening, when the light softens and the deer wander out to feed, Ridge curls up on the porch beside Matt — two creatures who chose the mountain life and learned how to endure it.` (303 chars, 2 sentences)

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/modules/entity_extraction.py` - Lines 157-287 (complete rewrite)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/modules/entity_extraction.py` - Updated to match

**Critical Fix - File Permissions:**
- Issue discovered: `entity_extraction.py` ownership changed to `root:root` after edit
- Prevented `spacy-filter` user from importing module
- All AI features (summaries, entities, topics) failed silently
- **Fixed:** Changed ownership to `spacy-filter:spacy-filter`
- Installer automatically sets correct permissions during installation

**Impact:**
- ✅ AI summaries now analyze actual email content
- ✅ Multi-sentence summaries for longer emails
- ✅ Intelligent NLP-based key point extraction
- ✅ Scales appropriately to email length
- ✅ No configuration changes required

---

#### Generic Release Messages
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Awaiting Testing
**Priority:** LOW - UX Improvement

**Problem:** Release success messages said "Email released and sent to mailguard" which is system-specific and confusing for other administrators who may not be using MailGuard.

**Solution:**
- Changed message from: `f'Email released and sent to {mode}'`
- To: `'Email released and delivered successfully'`
- Generic message works for any relay configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py` - Line 5031
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/quarantine_routes.py` - Line 328
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - Updated
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/quarantine_routes.py` - Updated

**Testing Required:**
- [ ] Release single email and verify message
- [ ] Bulk release and verify message
- [ ] Verify email actually delivers

---

#### Security Verification - Sensitive Data
**Status:** ✅ Verified Clean

**Checked for in Installer:**
- ❌ Phone number `17025618743` - Not found
- ❌ Phone formats `702-561-8743`, `+17025618743` - Not found
- ❌ ClickSend credentials - Not found
- ❌ ClickSend API keys - Not found
- ❌ `notification_config.json` - Not in installer (server-only)

**Result:** All personal credentials and phone numbers are server-specific and NOT included in installer files.

## Recent Session Summary (October 18, 2025 - Afternoon)

### 🔧 Installation Fix: Cleanup Script Deployment (v1.5.2)

#### Installation Completeness Fix
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** 1.5.2
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Installation Bug Fix

**Problem:** During dev server installation verification, discovered that `cleanup_expired_emails.py` was not being deployed during installation, and no cron job was configured to run it.

**Root Cause:**
- Installer had no code to copy cleanup script from `openefa-files/` to `/opt/spacyserver/`
- No cron job setup despite database having cleanup enabled (`cleanup_expired_emails_enabled: true`)
- Inconsistency: cleanup settings in database but script not available

**Fix Applied:**

1. **Package Dependencies** (`lib/packages.sh` line 47):
   - Added `cron` to core system packages
   - Ensures cron is installed on minimal Ubuntu installations
   - Dev testing revealed cron was missing on minimal installations

2. **File Deployment** (`lib/modules.sh` lines 43-49):
   - Added cleanup script copy to `copy_module_files()` function
   - Script deployed to `/opt/spacyserver/cleanup_expired_emails.py`
   - Permissions: 755, Owner: spacy-filter:spacy-filter

3. **Cron Job Setup** (`lib/services.sh` lines 147-175):
   - Created new `setup_cleanup_cron()` function
   - Configures daily cron job at 2:00 AM
   - Command: `/opt/spacyserver/venv/bin/python3 /opt/spacyserver/cleanup_expired_emails.py`
   - Output logged to `/opt/spacyserver/logs/cleanup.log`

4. **Integration** (`lib/services.sh` line 190):
   - Added `setup_cleanup_cron()` call to `setup_services()` function
   - Cron setup now runs automatically during installation

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check script exists
ls -lh /opt/spacyserver/cleanup_expired_emails.py

# Check cron job
sudo crontab -u spacy-filter -l | grep cleanup

# Check database settings
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT setting_key, setting_value FROM spacy_email_db.system_settings WHERE setting_key LIKE 'cleanup%';"
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Fresh installations now have complete cleanup system
- ✅ Cleanup script properly deployed with correct permissions
- ✅ Cron job automatically configured during installation
- ✅ Email retention system fully operational out-of-box

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/packages.sh` - Added cron to core packages

### 🛡️ ClamAV Antivirus Integration (v1.5.1)

#### Critical Security Enhancement: Email Virus Scanning
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** 1.5.1
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Security Feature

**Problem:** ClamAV daemon was running but emails were NOT being scanned for viruses despite the antivirus_scanner module existing.

**Root Cause:**
- Antivirus scanner module was registered but never invoked in email processing pipeline
- No integration point in analyze_email_with_modules() function

**Fix Applied:**
- Integrated antivirus_scanner into email processing pipeline (email_filter.py lines 1673-1710)
- All email attachments now scanned by ClamAV before delivery
- Virus detection adds +20 spam points and quarantines email
- Headers added: X-Virus-Detected, X-Virus-Names

**Testing:**
- Email ID 149544: Clean email (no attachment) ✅
- Email ID 149545: PDF attachment scanned successfully ✅
- Module execution confirmed in X-Analysis-Modules header ✅

**Impact:**
- ✅ All incoming emails now scanned for viruses
- ✅ Attachments checked against 27,796 virus signatures
- ✅ Infected emails automatically quarantined

## Recent Session Summary (October 18, 2025)

### 📊 Spam Score Header Enhancements & Bug Fixes (v1.5.0)

#### Critical Bug Fix: Spam Headers Not Stored in Database
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Version:** 1.5.0
**Severity:** HIGH

**Problem:** Comprehensive spam score headers (X-Spam-Score-Total, X-Spam-Score-Breakdown, etc.) were being added to emails but NOT appearing in the database.

**Root Cause:** Database storage happened BEFORE headers were added.
- Line 2738: `store_email_analysis_via_queue()` called (email stored WITHOUT headers)
- Line 2747: Headers added AFTER storage (too late!)

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved database storage call from line 2738 to line 2827 (AFTER all headers are added)
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/email_filter.py`
- Now all spam score headers are properly stored in raw_email field

**Testing:**
- Email ID 149528: Score 0.5 → `X-Spam-Score-Total: 0.5` ✅ stored
- Email ID 149529: Score 8.0 → `X-Spam-Score-Total: 8.0` ✅ stored
- Email ID 149530: Score 6.0 → `X-Spam-Score-Total: 6.0` ✅ stored

#### Header Cleanup: Removed Duplicate Spam Score Header
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Two headers showing the same total spam score:
- `X-SpaCy-Spam-Score: 6.0` (legacy)
- `X-Spam-Score-Total: 6.0` (new comprehensive header)

**Decision:** User preferred clarity of `X-Spam-Score-Total`

**Changes:**
- Removed `X-SpaCy-Spam-Score` header (line 2736)
- Kept `X-Spam-Score-Total` as the single source of truth
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/email_filter.py`

**Result:** Clean, non-redundant spam score headers

#### Thread Analysis: Removed Misleading "Disabled" Header
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Problem:** Header showed `X-Thread-Analysis: disabled` even though thread analysis was fully functional.

**Root Cause:** Legacy fallback code (lines 2798-2809) always added "disabled" status for reply emails, even when thread analysis successfully ran.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed misleading code block completely (lines 2798-2809)
- Thread analysis headers now accurately reflect status:
  - `X-Thread-Reply: True/False`
  - `X-Thread-Trust: -2 to 5`
  - `X-Fake-Reply-Detected: true` (when detected)
  - `X-Fake-Reply-Confidence: 0.95` (confidence score)
  - `X-Fake-Reply-Spam-Boost: 9.75` (spam penalty)

**Testing:**
- Email ID 149541: Fake reply detected with 95% confidence, 9.75 spam boost ✅

**Thread Analysis Features (Confirmed Working):**
1. ✅ Thread continuity checking (`check_thread_continuity()`)
2. ✅ Fake reply detection (catches "Re:" emails with no conversation history)
3. ✅ Thread trust scoring (1-5 scale for legitimate threads)
4. ✅ Spam score reduction for legitimate replies (3-10 points)
5. ✅ Spam score boost for fake replies (up to 10 points)

#### Mark as Not Spam Fix (from v1.4.0)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Marking email as "not spam" didn't update red spam indicator in UI.

**Fix:**
- Updated `/api/quarantine/<id>/not-spam` route
- Now reduces spam_score by 5.0 and sets email_category to 'clean'
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py` lines 5361-5371

#### Spam Score Breakdown Display (from v1.4.0)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Features:**
- Added comprehensive spam score breakdown card to email detail page
- Displays all module scores with color-coded risk levels
- Shows X-Spam-Score-Breakdown summary
- File: `/opt/spacyserver/web/templates/email_detail.html` lines 298-377

### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIX - Client Role Email Filtering (v1.3.1)

#### Security Vulnerability Patched
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Version:** 1.3.1

**Vulnerability:** Client role users could see ALL emails in their domain instead of only their own emails and managed aliases.

**Issue Details:**
- User reported: joe@openefa.org (client role) with alias contact@openefa.org could see scott@openefa.org's emails
- Root cause: Email filtering logic (lines 797-804 in app.py) filtered all non-admin users by authorized_domains
- This meant CLIENT role users saw the entire domain's emails, not just their own
- This is Priority #12 from the bug list

**Security Fix Applied:**
Modified `/emails` route filtering logic to differentiate between user roles:

**Before:**
```python
if not current_user.is_admin():
    # ALL non-admin users filtered by authorized domains
    authorized_domains = get_user_authorized_domains(current_user)
    # This allowed clients to see ALL domain emails
```

**After:**
```python
if not current_user.is_admin():
    if current_user.role == 'client':
        # CLIENT: Only see emails where they are sender/recipient/alias recipient
        # Query user_managed_aliases table for user's aliases
        # Build WHERE: (sender = user OR recipients LIKE user OR recipients LIKE alias)
    else:
        # DOMAIN_ADMIN: Continue seeing authorized domains
        authorized_domains = get_user_authorized_domains(current_user)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py` (Production) - Lines 796-830
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - Lines 796-830
- `/opt/openefa-installer/VERSION` - Bumped to 1.3.1

**Testing Required:**
- Log in as joe@openefa.org (client role)
- Verify joe ONLY sees:
  - Emails where sender = joe@openefa.org
  - Emails where recipients contains joe@openefa.org
  - Emails where recipients contains contact@openefa.org (joe's alias)
- Verify joe CANNOT see scott@openefa.org's emails

**Impact:**
- Critical security vulnerability fixed
- Client users now have proper email isolation
- Domain admins retain full domain visibility
- Super admins retain all email visibility

**New Table: `user_domain_assignments`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_domain_assignments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  created_by INT DEFAULT NULL,
  is_active TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1,
  UNIQUE KEY (user_id, domain),
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**New Stored Procedures:**
- `sp_assign_domain_to_user` - Assign domain to domain_admin user
- `sp_remove_domain_from_user` - Remove domain assignment
- `sp_get_user_domains` - Get all domains for a user

**New View:**
- `v_user_domains` - Join users with their assigned domains

**Migration Files:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/sql/migrations/000_create_migrations_table.sql`
- `/opt/openefa-installer/sql/migrations/001_add_domain_admin_role.sql`

**Updated Schema:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/sql/schema_v1.sql` - Added user_domain_assignments table (lines 820-833)

---

### Role System Implementation

**Three Roles:**
1. **admin** (SuperAdmin) - Full system access, all domains
2. **domain_admin** (Domain Admin) - Assigned domains only, manage domain users
3. **client** (User) - Own email address only, view own emails

**Access Control Matrix:**

| Feature | SuperAdmin | Domain Admin | User |
|---------|------------|--------------|------|
| View Emails | All domains | Assigned domains | Own emails |
| Manage Quarantine | All | Assigned domains | Own emails |
| User Management | All users | Domain users | None |
| Domain Config | All | Assigned domains | None |
| System Settings | Full access | None | None |

**Web Templates Updated:**
- Dropdown options show: User, Domain Admin, SuperAdmin
- Badge colors:
  - SuperAdmin: Red badge (bg-danger)
  - Domain Admin: Yellow badge (bg-warning text-dark)
  - User: Blue badge (bg-primary)

## Previous Session Summary (October 15, 2025)

### Major Features Implemented

#### 1. Domain Relay Host Management
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Full relay host configuration system for routing emails after processing.

**Components:**
- **Database:** Added `relay_host` column to `client_domains` table
- **Web UI:** Added relay host field to domain add/edit forms in `domain_management.html`
- **Backend:** `update_postfix_transport()` function in `app.py` automatically generates `/etc/postfix/transport`
- **Automation:** Automatic Postfix transport file updates and reload on domain add/edit/delete/toggle operations

**File Locations:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/sql/schema_v1.sql` - Schema with relay_host column
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - update_postfix_transport() function (lines 99-153)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/domain_management.html` - UI for relay host management
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/database.sh` - Insert relay_host when creating initial domains (lines 143-161)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/postfix.sh` - Transport file permissions and sudoers setup (lines 103-105, 285-297)

**How it Works:**
1. User adds/edits domain with relay host IP or hostname in web interface
2. Domain saved to database with relay_host value
3. `update_postfix_transport()` function automatically called
4. Function queries database for all active domains with relay_host
5. Generates `/etc/postfix/transport` file with format: `domain    smtp:[relay_host]`
6. Runs `postmap /etc/postfix/transport` to compile hash database
7. Runs `sudo /usr/sbin/postfix reload` to apply changes (passwordless via sudoers)

**Permissions:**
- Transport file: `spacy-filter:postfix` with mode 660
- Sudoers rule: `/etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix` allows `spacy-filter` to run `postfix reload` without password

**Testing:** ✅ Verified working with curl install on October 15, 2025

---

#### 2. Enhanced Email Viewing (All Emails)
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Complete rewrite of email detail view with headers, authentication data, and management actions.

**Components:**
- **Database Columns Added:**
  - `raw_email` (LONGTEXT) - Complete raw MIME email
  - `original_spf` (VARCHAR 50) - SPF authentication result
  - `original_dkim` (VARCHAR 50) - DKIM authentication result
  - `original_dmarc` (VARCHAR 50) - DMARC authentication result

- **Backend Processing:**
  - `db_processor.py` extracts authentication headers from raw emails using regex
  - Checks both custom `X-SpaCy-Auth-Results` header and standard `Authentication-Results` header
  - Stores in database for display

- **Web Interface:**
  - Collapsible email body section (Bootstrap 5 collapse component)
  - Headers display with "Show Headers" button
  - SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication results in Metadata section
  - Action buttons: Release, Whitelist, Mark as Spam, Delete

**File Locations:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/services/db_processor.py` - Authentication extraction (lines 291-352)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/modules/email_database.py` - SQLAlchemy model with new columns
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - Headers API endpoint (lines 4237-4312)
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/email_detail.html` - Complete UI rewrite

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/quarantine/<email_id>/headers` - Returns email headers (checks both email_quarantine and email_analysis tables)
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/release` - Release email to recipient
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/whitelist` - Add sender to whitelist
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/spam` - Mark as spam
- `POST /api/emails/<email_id>/delete` - Delete email

**Testing:** ✅ Verified working with curl install on October 15, 2025

---

#### 3. Quarantine Brief Content Preview
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Shows 3-5 line preview of email content in User Messages view instead of full content.

**Implementation:**
- Backend parsing in `quarantine_view()` function extracts first 3-5 lines or 250 characters
- Template displays `content_preview` field instead of `text_content`
- Improves page load performance and reduces clutter

**File Locations:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/app.py` - quarantine_view() function creates content_preview field
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/quarantine.html` - Line 374 displays preview

**Testing:** ✅ Verified working with curl install on October 15, 2025

---

#### 4. User Creation Form Improvements
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Prevents accidental wrong domain assignment during user creation.

**Changes:**
- Domain dropdown defaults to "Select Domain" (empty value)
- Required field validation prevents submission without domain selection
- Auto-populate feature disabled (commented out in JavaScript)
- Warning text: "⚠️ Please verify the domain is correct before creating the user"

**File Locations:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/admin/create_user.html` - Lines 43-49 (dropdown), 113-114 (disabled auto-populate)

**Testing:** ✅ Verified working with curl install on October 15, 2025

---

#### 5. Whitelist Management Domain Indicator
**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested

**Description:** Clear visual indication of which domain is currently being managed.

**Changes:**
- Header shows current domain in large badge: "Current Domain: [openefa.org]"
- Domain switcher dropdown highlights current domain with checkmark and "Current" badge
- Shows all available domains for multi-domain users

**File Locations:**
- `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/web/templates/whitelist_management.html` - Domain indicator in header and switcher

**Testing:** ✅ Verified working with curl install on October 15, 2025

---

---

### Installer Updates

**Files Modified:**
1. `/opt/openefa-installer/sql/schema_v1.sql` - Added all new columns
2. `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/database.sh` - Insert relay_host with initial domains, grant mysql.proc privilege
3. `/opt/openefa-installer/lib/postfix.sh` - Set transport file permissions and sudoers configuration

**Key Installer Changes:**

**database.sh (lines 143-161):**
```bash
# Now includes relay_host in INSERT
INSERT INTO client_domains (domain, client_name, relay_host, active, created_at)
VALUES ('${domain}', '${domain}', '${RELAY_SERVER_IP}', 1, NOW())
```

**postfix.sh (lines 103-105):**
```bash
# Set permissions so spacy-filter can update the transport file
chown spacy-filter:postfix "${transport_file}" "${transport_file}.db"
chmod 660 "${transport_file}" "${transport_file}.db"
```

**postfix.sh (lines 285-297):**
```bash
# Configure sudoers for Postfix reload
cat > /etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix << 'EOSUDO'
# Allow spacy-filter to reload Postfix for transport map updates
spacy-filter ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/postfix reload
EOSUDO
chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix
visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix
```

**Resolution:** Installer sets correct ownership (spacy-filter:postfix 660) and Python preserves it during writes
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue 2: Postfix reload permission denied**
**Problem:** Web app (running as spacy-filter) couldn't reload Postfix
**Resolution:** Added sudoers rule for passwordless `postfix reload` command
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue 3: Database backup privilege error**
**Problem:** SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE failed with insufficient privileges
**Resolution:** Added `GRANT SELECT ON mysql.proc` to installer
**Status:** ✅ Resolved

---

### File Permissions Reference

**Critical Files:**
```
/etc/postfix/transport        spacy-filter:postfix  660
/etc/postfix/transport.db      spacy-filter:postfix  660
/etc/sudoers.d/spacy-postfix   root:root             440
/opt/spacyserver/web/app.py    spacy-filter:spacy-filter  640
```

### Architecture Notes

**Email Flow:**
1. Email arrives at Postfix SMTP server
2. Postfix pipes to SpaCy filter (`email_filter.py`)
3. SpaCy filter processes email through modules
4. `db_processor.py` stores in database with headers and authentication data
5. If safe, email queued for delivery
6. Postfix checks transport map for relay host
7. Email delivered to configured relay host

**Transport Map Update Flow:**
1. User modifies domain via web interface (add/edit/delete/toggle)
2. `update_postfix_transport()` function called automatically
3. Function queries database for active domains with relay_host
4. Generates `/etc/postfix/transport` file
5. Runs `postmap` to compile hash database
6. Runs `sudo postfix reload` to apply changes
7. New routing immediately active

### Important Code References

**update_postfix_transport() function** (`app.py` lines 99-153):
```python
def update_postfix_transport():
    """
    Update Postfix transport file from database.
    Reads all active domains with relay_hosts and writes to /etc/postfix/transport
    """
    import subprocess
    transport_file = '/etc/postfix/transport'

    try:
        # Get all active domains with relay hosts from database
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT domain, relay_host
            FROM client_domains
            WHERE active = 1 AND relay_host IS NOT NULL AND relay_host != ''
            ORDER BY domain
        """)

        # Build transport file content
        # Write to file
        # Run postmap
        # Reload Postfix with sudo

        logger.info(f"Updated Postfix transport file with {len(domains)} domains and reloaded Postfix")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to update Postfix transport: {e}")
        return False
```

**Authentication Header Extraction** (`db_processor.py` lines 291-352):
- Parses raw email using `email.message_from_string()`
- Checks custom `X-SpaCy-Auth-Results` header first
- Falls back to standard `Authentication-Results` header
- Uses regex to extract SPF, DKIM, DMARC results
- Handles multiple formats and edge cases
