# Per-Domain Relay Host Support - Critical Bug Fix

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Bug Fix / Feature Enhancement
**Version:** 1.5.7.7
**File:** email_filter.py

---

## Problem

The email filter was using a **single global relay host** for ALL domains. This caused critical issues for multi-domain installations where different domains need to relay to different backend mail servers.

### Previous Behavior

```python
# OLD CODE - Single relay host for everyone
mailguard_host = CONFIG.config['servers']['mailguard_host']  # e.g., 192.168.50.114
mailguard_port = CONFIG.config['servers']['mailguard_port']  # e.g., 25

# All emails sent to the same server, regardless of domain
with smtplib.SMTP(mailguard_host, mailguard_port) as smtp:
    smtp.sendmail(sender, recipients, email_bytes)
```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Multi-tenant installations couldn't route different domains to different backend servers
- ❌ Domain A and Domain B forced to use the same relay host
- ❌ No support for per-domain relay_port (some servers use port 587, 2525, etc.)
- ❌ Database has relay_host and relay_port columns but they were **ignored**

---

## Solution

Completely rewrote the relay logic to support **per-domain relay hosts** by:

1. **Loading relay configuration from database** per domain
2. **Grouping recipients by domain**
3. **Relaying each domain to its own specific relay host/port**
4. **Fallback to default relay host** if domain doesn't have specific configuration

---

## Technical Changes

### Change 1: Load Per-Domain Relay Configuration

**File:** `email_filter.py` lines 235-261

**BEFORE:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT domain FROM client_domains WHERE active = 1")
domains = {row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall()}
```

**AFTER:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT domain, relay_host, relay_port FROM client_domains WHERE active = 1")
rows = cursor.fetchall()

if rows:
    domains = set()
    domain_relays = {}
    for row in rows:
        domain = row[0]
        relay_host = row[1] if row[1] else self.config['servers']['mailguard_host']
        relay_port = row[2] if row[2] else self.config['servers']['mailguard_port']
        domains.add(domain)
        domain_relays[domain] = {
            'relay_host': relay_host,
            'relay_port': relay_port
        }

    self.config['servers']['domain_relays'] = domain_relays
    print(f"✅ Loaded {len(domains)} processed domains from database", file=sys.stderr)
    for domain, relay in domain_relays.items():
        print(f"   {domain} -> {relay['relay_host']}:{relay['relay_port']}", file=sys.stderr)
```

**What Changed:**
- Now queries **3 columns**: domain, relay_host, relay_port
- Builds a `domain_relays` dictionary mapping each domain to its relay configuration
- Logs each domain's relay configuration on startup
- Falls back to default mailguard_host/port if domain doesn't have specific relay

---

### Change 2: Group Recipients by Domain

**File:** `email_filter.py` lines 2082-2112

**BEFORE:**
```python
validated_recipients = []
for recipient in recipients:
    if '@' in recipient:
        domain = recipient.split('@')[1].lower()
        if domain in processed_domains:
            validated_recipients.append(recipient)

# Send ALL recipients to the same server
smtp.sendmail(sender, validated_recipients, email_bytes)
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# Group recipients by domain
recipients_by_domain = {}

for recipient in recipients:
    if '@' in recipient:
        domain = recipient.split('@')[1].lower()
        if domain in processed_domains:
            if domain not in recipients_by_domain:
                recipients_by_domain[domain] = []
            recipients_by_domain[domain].append(recipient)

# Relay to each domain's specific relay host
for domain, domain_recipients in recipients_by_domain.items():
    # Get relay host for this domain
    if domain in domain_relays:
        mailguard_host = domain_relays[domain]['relay_host']
        mailguard_port = domain_relays[domain]['relay_port']
    else:
        mailguard_host = default_host
        mailguard_port = default_port

    safe_log(f"Relaying {len(domain_recipients)} recipients for {domain} to {mailguard_host}:{mailguard_port}")

    with smtplib.SMTP(mailguard_host, mailguard_port, timeout=smtp_timeout) as smtp:
        smtp.sendmail(sender, domain_recipients, email_bytes)
        safe_log(f"✅ Email relayed to {mailguard_host}:{mailguard_port} for {len(domain_recipients)} recipients ({domain})")
```

**What Changed:**
- Recipients grouped by domain into `recipients_by_domain` dictionary
- Each domain's recipients sent to that domain's specific relay host
- Separate SMTP connection for each domain's relay server
- Independent error handling per domain (one domain failing doesn't block others)

---

### Change 3: Main Processing Loop Per-Domain Relay

**File:** `email_filter.py` lines 3045-3097

**BEFORE:**
```python
# Single relay attempt
mailguard_host = CONFIG.config['servers']['mailguard_host']
mailguard_port = CONFIG.config['servers']['mailguard_port']

safe_log(f"Relaying to {mailguard_host}:{mailguard_port}")

with smtplib.SMTP(mailguard_host, mailguard_port, timeout=smtp_timeout) as smtp:
    smtp.sendmail(envelope_sender, recipients, msg.as_bytes())
    safe_log(f"✅ Email relayed to MailGuard for {len(recipients)} recipients")
```

**AFTER:**
```python
# Group recipients by domain and relay to each domain's specific relay host
domain_relays = CONFIG.config['servers'].get('domain_relays', {})
processed_domains = CONFIG.config['domains']['processed_domains']
default_host = CONFIG.config['servers']['mailguard_host']
default_port = CONFIG.config['servers']['mailguard_port']

# Group recipients by domain
recipients_by_domain = {}
for recipient in recipients:
    if '@' in recipient:
        domain = recipient.split('@')[1].lower()
        if domain in processed_domains:
            if domain not in recipients_by_domain:
                recipients_by_domain[domain] = []
            recipients_by_domain[domain].append(recipient)

# Relay to each domain's specific relay host
relay_success = True
for domain, domain_recipients in recipients_by_domain.items():
    # Get relay host for this domain
    if domain in domain_relays:
        mailguard_host = domain_relays[domain]['relay_host']
        mailguard_port = domain_relays[domain]['relay_port']
    else:
        mailguard_host = default_host
        mailguard_port = default_port

    safe_log(f"Relaying {len(domain_recipients)} recipients for {domain} to {mailguard_host}:{mailguard_port}")

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP(mailguard_host, mailguard_port, timeout=smtp_timeout) as smtp:
            smtp.sendmail(envelope_sender, domain_recipients, msg.as_bytes())
            safe_log(f"✅ Email relayed to {mailguard_host}:{mailguard_port} for {len(domain_recipients)} recipients ({domain})")
    except Exception as relay_error:
        safe_log(f"❌ Failed to relay to {mailguard_host}:{mailguard_port} for {domain}: {relay_error}")
        relay_success = False

if relay_success:
    sys.exit(0)  # Success
else:
    sys.exit(1)  # Partial or complete failure
```

**What Changed:**
- Same grouping logic as `relay_to_mailguard()` function
- Each domain gets its own SMTP connection to its designated relay server
- Independent error handling - one domain failing doesn't stop others
- Proper exit code (0 = all success, 1 = any failure)

---

## Example Scenario

### Database Configuration

```sql
SELECT domain, relay_host, relay_port FROM client_domains WHERE active = 1;
```

| domain | relay_host | relay_port |
|--------|------------|------------|
| openefa.org | 192.168.50.114 | 25 |
| sadefensejournal.com | 24.234.149.29 | 587 |
| seguelogic.com | 192.168.50.114 | 25 |

### Email Processing

**Email with mixed recipients:**
```
To: user1@openefa.org, user2@sadefensejournal.com, user3@seguelogic.com
```

**OLD BEHAVIOR** (BROKEN):
```
Relaying to 192.168.50.114:25
✅ Email relayed to MailGuard for 3 recipients
```
❌ **Problem:** Email for sadefensejournal.com sent to wrong server!

**NEW BEHAVIOR** (FIXED):
```
Relaying 1 recipients for openefa.org to 192.168.50.114:25
✅ Email relayed to 192.168.50.114:25 for 1 recipients (openefa.org)

Relaying 1 recipients for sadefensejournal.com to 24.234.149.29:587
✅ Email relayed to 24.234.149.29:587 for 1 recipients (sadefensejournal.com)

Relaying 1 recipients for seguelogic.com to 192.168.50.114:25
✅ Email relayed to 192.168.50.114:25 for 1 recipients (seguelogic.com)
```
✅ **Correct:** Each domain sent to its designated backend server!

---

## Startup Output

When email_filter.py initializes, you'll now see:

```
✅ Loaded 3 processed domains from database
   openefa.org -> 192.168.50.114:25
   sadefensejournal.com -> 24.234.149.29:587
   seguelogic.com -> 192.168.50.114:25
```

This confirms the per-domain relay configuration is loaded correctly.

---

## Benefits

1. **✅ Multi-Tenant Support:** Different domains can use different backend mail servers
2. **✅ Port Flexibility:** Each domain can specify its own SMTP port (25, 587, 2525, etc.)
3. **✅ Database-Driven:** Configuration comes from database, not hardcoded
4. **✅ Fallback Protection:** Domains without specific relay use default mailguard_host
5. **✅ Independent Failure Handling:** One domain failing doesn't block others
6. **✅ Detailed Logging:** Clear visibility into which domain goes where
7. **✅ Uses Existing Database Schema:** No schema changes needed - relay_host/relay_port columns already existed

---

## Testing

### Verify Configuration Loaded

```bash
# Check email filter startup logs
sudo tail -100 /var/log/mail.log | grep "Loaded.*domains"
```

**Expected:**
```
✅ Loaded 3 processed domains from database
   openefa.org -> 192.168.50.114:25
   sadefensejournal.com -> 24.234.149.29:587
   seguelogic.com -> 192.168.50.114:25
```

### Test Per-Domain Relay

```bash
# Send test email with recipients in different domains
echo "Test multi-domain relay" | mail -s "Test" \
  user1@openefa.org,user2@sadefensejournal.com
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
sudo tail -50 /var/log/mail.log
```

**Expected:**
```
Relaying 1 recipients for openefa.org to 192.168.50.114:25
✅ Email relayed to 192.168.50.114:25 for 1 recipients (openefa.org)
Relaying 1 recipients for sadefensejournal.com to 24.234.149.29:587
✅ Email relayed to 24.234.149.29:587 for 1 recipients (sadefensejournal.com)
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/opt/spacyserver/email_filter.py` (Production - Applied Oct 20 16:14)
- ⏳ `/opt/openefa-installer/openefa-files/email_filter.py` (Installer - Pending)

---

## Database Requirements

This fix uses **existing** database columns:
- `client_domains.relay_host` (VARCHAR 255, nullable)
- `client_domains.relay_port` (INT, nullable, default: 25)

**No database migration needed!**

---

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **Fully backwards compatible**

If domains don't have relay_host configured:
```sql
UPDATE client_domains SET relay_host = NULL WHERE domain = 'example.com';
```

The code will use default:
```python
relay_host = row[1] if row[1] else self.config['servers']['mailguard_host']
relay_port = row[2] if row[2] else self.config['servers']['mailguard_port']
```

---

## Impact Assessment

### Critical Bug Fix
- ❌ **BEFORE:** Multi-domain installations couldn't route emails correctly
- ✅ **AFTER:** Each domain routes to its designated backend server

### Use Cases Enabled
1. **Service Provider:** Host multiple clients with different backend Exchange servers
2. **Multi-Office:** Route different offices to their local mail servers
3. **Hybrid Cloud:** Some domains to on-prem, some to cloud (Office 365, Google Workspace)
4. **Custom Ports:** Support backend servers on non-standard ports (587, 2525, etc.)
