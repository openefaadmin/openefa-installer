# What is OpenEFA?

**Open Email Filtering and Analytics System**

---

## Overview

OpenEFA (Open Email Filtering and Analytics) is a comprehensive, intelligent email security system that combines advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and behavioral analysis to protect organizations from spam, phishing, Business Email Compromise (BEC), malware, and other email-based threats.

Unlike traditional rule-based spam filters, OpenEFA uses adaptive learning to understand your organization's communication patterns and continuously improve its detection accuracy.
