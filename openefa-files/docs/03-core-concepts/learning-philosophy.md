# Learning and Relationship Philosophy

**OpenEFA's Intelligent Email Analysis System**

---

## Overview

OpenEFA employs a sophisticated two-tier learning approach that combines **system-wide vocabulary intelligence** with **per-domain relationship tracking**. This architecture maximizes spam detection accuracy while maintaining complete isolation between different companies and domains in multi-tenant deployments.

This document explains the design philosophy, technical implementation, and benefits of this hybrid approach.

---

## The Two-Tier Learning Architecture

### System-Wide Components (Shared Intelligence)
- **Vocabulary patterns** - Learned words and terminology
- **Professional phrases** - Business communication patterns
- **Spam indicators** - Attack pattern recognition
- **Language understanding** - General NLP intelligence

### Per-Domain Components (Behavioral Isolation)
- **Sender-recipient relationships** - Who communicates with whom
- **Domain trust scores** - Sender reputation per recipient
- **Communication patterns** - Message frequency and timing
- **Whitelist/Blocklist** - Explicit allow/deny rules

---

## Why System-Wide Vocabulary is Superior

### 1. Language Understanding vs. Domain Behavior

**The Core Principle:**
- **Vocabulary learning** = Understanding the English language and professional communication
- **Relationship tracking** = Understanding domain-specific behavior and trust patterns

These are fundamentally different problems requiring different solutions.

**Example:**
```
Medical Company Email:
"Following up on patient diagnosis, please find attached lab results.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."

Construction Company Email:
"Following up on contractor schedule, please find attached blueprint revisions.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."

Common Vocabulary: 85%
└─ "following up", "please find attached", "thank you", "prompt attention"

Industry-Specific: 15%
└─ Medical: "patient", "diagnosis", "lab results"
└─ Construction: "contractor", "schedule", "blueprint"
```

**Key Insight:** The spam/ham indicators are in the 85%, not the 15%.

---

### 2. The 80/20 Rule in Business Communication

Analysis of typical business emails shows:

| Content Type | Percentage | Examples |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **Standard Business Language** | 80-90% | "regarding", "attached", "please review", "meeting", "invoice", "payment", "thank you", "sincerely", "best regards" |
| **Industry-Specific Terms** | 10-20% | Medical: "patient", "prescription"<br>Construction: "contractor", "blueprint"<br>Legal: "plaintiff", "deposition" |

**The industry-specific terms are:**
- The minority of content
- Usually NOT spam indicators
- Less important for spam detection

---

### 3. Spam Doesn't Care About Industry

Phishing, scams, and spam use the **same tactics** regardless of target industry:

| Attack Type | Universal Indicators |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Urgency Manipulation** | "ACT NOW!", "URGENT!", "LIMITED TIME", "EXPIRES TODAY" |
| **Authority Impersonation** | "CEO", "CFO", "President", "IT Department", "Security Team" |
| **Financial Threats** | "Account suspended", "Payment required", "Verify immediately" |
| **Link Manipulation** | Typosquatting domains, shortened URLs, suspicious TLDs |
| **Poor Quality** | Grammar errors, formatting issues, generic greetings |

**A phishing email looks suspicious whether targeting:**
- A hospital administrator
- A construction company owner
- A law firm partner
- A retail business manager

---

### 4. Machine Learning Benefits from More Data

**System-Wide Vocabulary:**
```
Total Emails Processed: 100,000+
Unique Word Patterns Learned: 10,000+
Professional Phrases: 500+
Spam Indicators: 1,000+

Result: Highly accurate language model
```

**Per-Domain Vocabulary (if implemented):**
```
Emails per Domain: 1,000-5,000
Unique Patterns per Domain: 500-1,000
Professional Phrases: 50-100
Spam Indicators: 100-200

Result: 10-20x less training data = less accuracy
```

**Mathematical Reality:** More training data = better machine learning models.

---

### 5. New Domains Get Immediate Intelligence

| Approach | Day 1 Performance | Week 1 Performance | Month 1 Performance |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **System-Wide Vocabulary** | ✅ Excellent<br>(Benefits from all prior learning) | ✅ Excellent<br>(Continues learning) | ✅ Excellent<br>(Domain relationships now mature) |
| **Per-Domain Vocabulary** | ❌ Poor<br>(Starting from zero) | ⚠️ Fair<br>(Limited data) | ✅ Good<br>(Finally enough data) |

**Business Impact:**
- **System-wide:** New customer protected immediately
- **Per-domain:** New customer vulnerable for weeks/months

---

## Current Architecture: The Optimal Design

### Database Schema Design

```
SYSTEM-WIDE TABLES (Shared Intelligence)
├── conversation_vocabulary
│   ├── word_hash (privacy-preserving)
│   ├── frequency (how often seen in legitimate email)
│   └── last_seen (timestamp)
│
├── conversation_phrases
│   ├── phrase (e.g., "following up", "please find attached")
│   ├── frequency (usage count)
│   └── avg_spam_score (average score when phrase present)
│
PER-DOMAIN TABLES (Behavioral Isolation)
├── conversation_relationships
│   ├── sender_domain (who is sending)
│   ├── recipient_domain (who is receiving)
│   ├── message_count (relationship strength)
│   ├── avg_spam_score (sender reputation for this recipient)
│   └── last_communication (timestamp)
│
└── conversation_domain_stats
    ├── domain (specific domain)
    ├── total_messages (activity level)
    ├── avg_message_length (communication style)
    ├── avg_spam_score (overall domain quality)
    └── common_topics (domain-specific patterns)
```

---

## Scoring Weights: Relationships Matter Most

From `conversation_learner_mysql.py:341-350`:

```python
weights = {
    'vocabulary_match': 0.25,        # 25% - Language understanding
    'domain_relationship': 0.35,     # 35% - WHO is talking (HIGHEST)
    'phrase_match': 0.25,            # 25% - Professional tone
    'conversation_style': 0.15       # 15% - Formatting/structure
}
```

### Why Domain Relationship Carries 35% Weight

**Domain relationships are the strongest signal because:**

1. **Historical trust** - "This sender has successfully emailed this recipient 50 times"
2. **Behavioral consistency** - "Messages from this relationship average spam score: 2.3"
3. **Established patterns** - "They communicate every Tuesday at 9 AM"
4. **Impersonation detection** - "This sender NEVER contacted this recipient before"

**Real-World Example:**
```
Scenario: Email from contractor@acme-construction.com to admin@hospital-systems.com

Domain Relationship Check:
├── Query: conversation_relationships table
├── sender_domain = 'acme-construction.com'
├── recipient_domain = 'hospital-systems.com'
├── Result: 47 previous messages, avg_spam_score = 2.1
└── Score Impact: +0.35 (strong legitimate relationship)

This OVERRIDES the fact that "contractor" and "blueprint" might not be
in the hospital's typical vocabulary.
```

---

## Multi-Tenant Considerations

### How Different Companies Coexist

**Scenario:** OpenEFA instance serving:
- Medical practice (medigroup.com)
- Construction company (builders-inc.com)
- Law firm (legal-partners.com)
- Retail business (shopmart.com)

### Shared Knowledge (Benefits All)
```
System-Wide Vocabulary Database:
├── Business terms: "invoice", "payment", "meeting", "schedule"
├── Professional phrases: "thank you", "best regards", "please advise"
├── Spam indicators: "urgent action", "click here", "verify account"
└── Language patterns: Sentence structure, tone, formality

All domains contribute → All domains benefit
```

### Isolated Relationships (Protection)
```
Per-Domain Relationship Tracking:

medigroup.com relationships:
├── insurance-provider.com (trust score: 9/10, 234 messages)
├── lab-testing-services.com (trust score: 8/10, 156 messages)
└── Does NOT see builders-inc.com relationships

builders-inc.com relationships:
├── supplier-concrete.com (trust score: 9/10, 189 messages)
├── subcontractor-electric.com (trust score: 7/10, 98 messages)
└── Does NOT see medigroup.com relationships

Result: Complete behavioral isolation between companies
```

## Real-World Analogy: How Major Email Providers Work

### Gmail/Microsoft/Yahoo Approach

**System-Wide Spam Detection:**
- Trained on **billions** of emails across all users
- Learns universal spam patterns
- Doesn't have separate models for doctors vs. lawyers
- More data = better accuracy

**Per-User Personalization:**
- Personal contacts list
- User-specific filters
- Individual sender trust
- Personal whitelist/blacklist

**OpenEFA Uses the Same Proven Architecture:**
```
Gmail/Microsoft          →    OpenEFA
────────────────────────────────────────────
Global spam model        →    System-wide vocabulary
Per-user contacts        →    Per-domain relationships
Universal spam patterns  →    Shared spam indicators
Individual preferences   →    Domain-specific rules
```

This is **industry best practice**, not a custom experiment.

---

## Privacy and Security

### Privacy-Preserving Vocabulary Learning

OpenEFA doesn't store actual words in the vocabulary table:

```python
def hash_word(self, word: str) -> str:
    """Hash a word for privacy-preserving storage"""
    salt = "spacy_conv_2025"
    return hashlib.sha256(f"{salt}{word.lower()}".encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
```

**What's Stored:**
- ✅ Hashed representations of words (non-reversible)
- ✅ Frequency counts
- ✅ Statistical patterns

**What's NOT Stored:**
- ❌ Actual email content
- ❌ Sensitive terminology in plain text
- ❌ Email addresses (hashed)
- ❌ Numbers or identifiers

### Cross-Tenant Data Isolation

**System-Wide Vocabulary:**
- Contains only hashed, non-reversible word representations
- Cannot be traced back to specific companies
- No sensitive business data

**Per-Domain Relationships:**
- Completely isolated per recipient domain
- `sender_domain` + `recipient_domain` pairs are unique
- No cross-tenant data access possible

**Whitelist/Blocklist:**
- Stored with `recipient_domain` field
- Each domain sees only their own rules
- Complete isolation enforced at database level

---

## Benefits Summary

## Technical Implementation

### Learning Process Flow

```
Incoming Email
     ↓
[Extract Features]
     ├─→ Vocabulary (words) → System-Wide DB
     ├─→ Phrases (patterns) → System-Wide DB
     ├─→ Sender Domain → Per-Domain Relationship DB
     ├─→ Recipient Domain → Per-Domain Relationship DB
     └─→ Communication Stats → Per-Domain Stats DB
     ↓
[Calculate Scores]
     ├─→ Vocabulary Match (25%)
     ├─→ Domain Relationship (35%) ← HIGHEST WEIGHT
     ├─→ Phrase Match (25%)
     └─→ Conversation Style (15%)
     ↓
[Spam Score Adjustment]
     ├─→ Strong legitimate pattern → Reduce spam score
     ├─→ Unknown pattern → Neutral
     └─→ Suspicious pattern → Increase spam score
     ↓
[Learn from Email]
     └─→ If spam_score < 2.5 → Add to learning database
```

### Learning Thresholds

```python
# From conversation_learner_mysql.py

LEARNING_THRESHOLD = 2.5  # Only learn from very clean emails
STRONG_LEGITIMACY = 0.7   # High confidence this is legitimate
HIGH_CONFIDENCE = 0.4     # Minimum confidence to adjust score
MAX_ADJUSTMENT = 2.0      # Maximum spam score reduction
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Regular Business Communication

**Email:** Construction company → Medical practice
```
From: contractor@builders-inc.com
To: admin@medigroup.com
Subject: Re: Building expansion project update

Hi Sarah,

Following up on our meeting last Tuesday. Please find attached
the revised blueprint for the new medical wing. The contractor
estimates we can begin foundation work next month.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Mike Thompson
```

**Analysis:**
```
System-Wide Vocabulary Check:
├─ "following up" ✅ (found, freq: 2,450)
├─ "please find attached" ✅ (found, freq: 3,120)
├─ "best regards" ✅ (found, freq: 4,890)
└─ Vocabulary Score: 0.8/1.0

Domain Relationship Check:
├─ builders-inc.com → medigroup.com
├─ Previous messages: 23
├─ Average spam score: 2.3
└─ Relationship Score: 1.0/1.0 (strong relationship)

Professional Phrase Check:
├─ "please let me know if you have any questions" ✅
└─ Phrase Score: 0.9/1.0

Conversation Style:
├─ Has greeting: ✅
├─ Has signature: ✅
├─ Appropriate length: ✅
└─ Style Score: 1.0/1.0

FINAL LEGITIMACY SCORE:
(0.8 × 0.25) + (1.0 × 0.35) + (0.9 × 0.25) + (1.0 × 0.15) = 0.925

Spam Score Adjustment: -1.85 (reduce spam score)
```

**Outcome:** Email passes through even though construction terms sent to medical practice.

---

### Scenario 2: First Contact (Unknown Relationship)

**Email:** New vendor → Medical practice
```
From: sales@medical-supplies-new.com
To: purchasing@medigroup.com
Subject: Medical supply catalog

Dear Purchasing Manager,

I wanted to introduce our company as a supplier of medical
diagnostic equipment. Please find our catalog attached.

Thank you,
John Smith
```

**Analysis:**
```
System-Wide Vocabulary Check:
├─ "introduce", "supplier", "catalog", "attached" ✅
└─ Vocabulary Score: 0.6/1.0

Domain Relationship Check:
├─ medical-supplies-new.com → medigroup.com
├─ Previous messages: 0 ← NO RELATIONSHIP
└─ Relationship Score: 0.0/1.0

Professional Phrase Check:
├─ "please find", "thank you" ✅
└─ Phrase Score: 0.5/1.0

Conversation Style:
├─ Has greeting: ✅
├─ Has signature: ✅
└─ Style Score: 0.7/1.0

FINAL LEGITIMACY SCORE:
(0.6 × 0.25) + (0.0 × 0.35) + (0.5 × 0.25) + (0.7 × 0.15) = 0.38

Spam Score Adjustment: 0 (insufficient confidence)
```

**Outcome:** Email scored normally (relationship weight is zero). May be quarantined if spam score is borderline. This is correct behavior - unknown senders should be treated with caution.

---

### Scenario 3: Phishing Attempt

**Email:** Fake CEO → Medical practice
```
From: ceo@medigroup-secure.com  ← Typosquatting!
To: accounting@medigroup.com
Subject: URGENT: Wire transfer needed NOW

URGENT!!!

I need you to wire $45,000 IMMEDIATELY to this account.
This is time-sensitive, ACT NOW or we lose the deal!

Click here to verify: http://bit.ly/xyz123

CEO
```

**Analysis:**
```
System-Wide Vocabulary Check:
├─ "URGENT", "IMMEDIATELY", "ACT NOW" ⚠️ (spam indicators!)
└─ Vocabulary Score: 0.1/1.0 (suspicious words)

Domain Relationship Check:
├─ medigroup-secure.com → medigroup.com
├─ Previous messages: 0 ← TYPOSQUATTING DOMAIN
└─ Relationship Score: 0.0/1.0

Professional Phrase Check:
├─ No professional phrases found
└─ Phrase Score: 0.0/1.0

Conversation Style:
├─ No proper greeting ❌
├─ No signature ❌
├─ All caps ❌
└─ Style Score: 0.2/1.0

FINAL LEGITIMACY SCORE:
(0.1 × 0.25) + (0.0 × 0.35) + (0.0 × 0.25) + (0.2 × 0.15) = 0.055

Spam Score Adjustment: +0.5 (INCREASE spam score)

Additional Checks:
├─ BEC Detector: TRIGGERED (CEO impersonation)
├─ URL Reputation: SUSPICIOUS (shortened URL)
└─ Brand Impersonation: TRIGGERED (typosquatting)
```

**Outcome:** Email blocked/quarantined with high spam score.

## FAQ: Common Questions

### Q: Won't medical terms make construction emails look like spam?

**A:** No, because:
1. Industry-specific terms are only 10-20% of content
2. Spam indicators are universal (urgency, threats, manipulation)
3. Domain relationships carry the highest weight (35%)
4. Legitimate business language is shared across industries

### Q: What if two domains never communicated before?

**A:** The system handles this gracefully:
- Domain relationship score = 0 (neutral, not negative)
- Email is scored on vocabulary, phrases, and style
- First contact is possible, just scrutinized more carefully
- After first legitimate exchange, relationship begins building

### Q: Can one company's spam affect another company?

**A:** No:
- Spam contributes minimally to vocabulary (only clean emails are learned)
- Relationships are completely isolated per domain
- Whitelists/blocklists are per-domain
- Each domain maintains independent sender trust scores

### Q: How long until a new domain is "fully trained"?

**A:**
- **Day 1:** Immediate benefit from system-wide vocabulary (80-90% effective)
- **Week 1:** Domain relationships begin forming (90-95% effective)
- **Month 1:** Strong relationship data built (95-99% effective)

Contrast with per-domain approach:
- **Day 1:** 20-30% effective (starting from zero)
- **Week 1:** 40-50% effective (limited data)
- **Month 1:** 70-80% effective (still building)

## Monitoring and Statistics

### Learning Statistics Query

```sql
-- Overall system learning
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversation_vocabulary WHERE frequency > 5) as vocabulary_size,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversation_phrases WHERE frequency > 3) as phrase_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT domain) FROM conversation_domain_stats) as domains_tracked,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversation_relationships WHERE message_count > 5) as relationships
FROM DUAL;
```

### Per-Domain Relationship Strength

```sql
-- Check relationship strength for a specific domain
SELECT
    sender_domain,
    message_count,
    avg_spam_score,
    DATEDIFF(NOW(), last_communication) as days_since_contact
FROM conversation_relationships
WHERE recipient_domain = 'yourdomain.com'
ORDER BY message_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Learning Progress Over Time

```sql
-- Daily learning activity
SELECT
    date,
    patterns_learned,
    emails_processed
FROM conversation_learning_progress
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

---

## Configuration Options

### Max Spam Score Adjustment

From `/opt/spacyserver/config/conversation_learning_config`:

```sql
INSERT INTO conversation_learning_config (config_key, config_value)
VALUES ('max_adjustment', '2.0');
```

**What it controls:**
- Maximum spam score reduction for legitimate patterns
- Default: 2.0 (can reduce spam score by up to 2 points)
- Higher = More aggressive learning adjustments
- Lower = More conservative adjustments

### Learning Threshold

In `conversation_learner_mysql.py`:

```python
# Only learn from very clean emails
if spam_score > 2.5:
    return False  # Don't learn from this email
```

**What it controls:**
- Which emails contribute to learning database
- Default: 2.5 (only emails with spam score < 2.5 are learned)
- Lower = More selective learning (only very clean emails)
- Higher = More permissive learning (risk learning spam patterns)

---

## Best Practices

### For Multi-Tenant Deployments

✅ **DO:**
- Trust the system-wide vocabulary approach
- Monitor per-domain relationship building
- Review learning statistics monthly
- Tune thresholds based on actual performance

❌ **DON'T:**
- Try to implement per-domain vocabulary
- Worry about industry-specific terminology
- Over-tune on a single false positive
- Disable learning features

### For Administrators

✅ **DO:**
- Monitor the learning progress dashboard
- Review top domain relationships periodically
- Check for domains with zero relationships (new or unused)
- Analyze quarantine patterns for false positives

❌ **DON'T:**
- Manually add vocabulary (hashed, won't work)
- Delete relationship data (breaks trust scores)
- Set learning threshold too high (learns spam)
- Disable domain relationship tracking

---

## Conclusion

OpenEFA's two-tier learning architecture - **system-wide vocabulary with per-domain relationships** - represents the optimal balance between:

- **Intelligence:** Large shared vocabulary database
- **Isolation:** Complete per-domain relationship separation
- **Accuracy:** Relationships weighted highest (35%)
- **Privacy:** Hashed vocabulary, isolated relationships
- **Performance:** Immediate protection for new domains
- **Scalability:** Works efficiently in multi-tenant deployments

This design follows industry best practices used by major email providers and is backed by both machine learning theory and real-world effectiveness.

The architecture ensures that different companies (medical, construction, legal, retail, etc.) coexist harmoniously, sharing language intelligence while maintaining completely isolated behavioral profiles.
