# ClickSend SMS Notifications for OpenEFA - Real-Time Alerts & System Monitoring

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive SMS notification system for OpenEFA using ClickSend's API. This gives you real-time alerts for email threats and system issues directly to your phone.

## 📱 What This Does

The notification system sends SMS alerts for:

### Real-Time Email Threat Alerts
- **Phishing Detection** - Instant alert when phishing attempts are blocked
- **BEC Attacks** - Business Email Compromise attempts (high confidence ≥0.8)
- **Virus Detection** - Any virus found in email attachments
- **High Spam Scores** - Emails with spam score ≥80 that get quarantined

### System Health Monitoring (Every 10 Minutes)
- **Postfix Down** - Mail server stopped or crashed
- **Mail Queue Backed Up** - More than 10 emails stuck in queue
- **Database Offline** - MySQL connection failures
- **Disk Space Critical** - Disk usage over 90%

### Daily Summary Reports (8 AM)
- Total emails processed in last 24 hours
- Spam blocked count
- Threats detected
- Quarantined emails

## 🎯 Key Features

- **No Hard-Coded Credentials** - All config in JSON file for easy distribution
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevents SMS spam (max 10/hour per recipient, 30-min cooldown)
- **Database Logging** - Full audit trail of all notifications
- **Multiple Recipients** - Support for multiple phone numbers
- **Customizable Templates** - Edit message formats to your preference
- **Backend Only** - No GUI needed, pure backend service
- **Error Handling** - Won't break email filter if ClickSend fails
- **Alert Cooldown** - Won't spam you with duplicate alerts

## 🔧 Database Tables

Three tables are automatically created:

1. **notification_log** - Tracks all sent notifications
2. **notification_rate_limit** - Manages rate limiting
3. **notification_settings** - Stores system settings

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Sign Up for ClickSend
1. Create account at https://www.clicksend.com
2. Navigate to: Developers & API > API Credentials
3. Copy your API Username and API Key
4. Add SMS credits to your account

### Step 2: Install ClickSend Library
```bash
/opt/spacyserver/venv/bin/pip install clicksend-client
```

### Step 3: Create Database Tables
```bash
mysql -u root -p spacy_email_db < /opt/spacyserver/sql/create_notification_tables.sql
```

### Step 4: Configure Your Credentials
Edit `/opt/spacyserver/config/notification_config.json`:

```json
{
  "clicksend": {
    "enabled": true,
    "username": "YOUR_CLICKSEND_USERNAME",
    "api_key": "YOUR_CLICKSEND_API_KEY",
    "from_number": "OpenEFA"
  },
  "notification_settings": {
    "high_risk_alerts": {
      "enabled": true,
      "spam_score_threshold": 80,
      "recipients": [
        "+12345678901"
      ]
    },
    "system_alerts": {
      "enabled": true,
      "recipients": [
        "+12345678901"
      ]
    },
    "daily_summary": {
      "enabled": true,
      "recipients": [
        "+12345678901"
      ],
      "send_time": "08:00",
      "timezone": "America/New_York"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Phone numbers MUST include country code (e.g., +1 for US)

### Step 5: Test Your Setup
```bash
# Test ClickSend connection
/opt/spacyserver/notification_service.py test

# Send test alert
/opt/spacyserver/notification_service.py alert "Test notification from OpenEFA"

# Test daily summary
/opt/spacyserver/scripts/send_daily_notification_summary.py
```

### Step 6: Add Cron Jobs
```bash
sudo crontab -e -u spacy-filter
```

Add these lines:
```
# Send daily notification summary at 8:00 AM
0 8 * * * /opt/spacyserver/venv/bin/python3 /opt/spacyserver/scripts/send_daily_notification_summary.py >> /opt/spacyserver/logs/daily_summary.log 2>&1

# Monitor system health every 10 minutes
*/10 * * * * /opt/spacyserver/venv/bin/python3 /opt/spacyserver/scripts/system_health_monitor.py >> /opt/spacyserver/logs/health_monitor.log 2>&1
```

## 🧪 Testing System Alerts

Test Postfix down alert:
```bash
# Stop Postfix
systemctl stop postfix

# Run health monitor (should send alert)
/opt/spacyserver/venv/bin/python3 /opt/spacyserver/scripts/system_health_monitor.py

# Restart Postfix
systemctl start postfix
```

You should receive an SMS: "CRITICAL: Postfix mail server is DOWN"

## 📊 Integration with email_filter.py

The notification service is automatically integrated into `email_filter.py`:

- **Line ~1299** - Phishing detection triggers SMS
- **Line ~1493** - BEC detection (confidence ≥0.8) triggers SMS
- **Line ~1734** - Virus detection triggers SMS
- **Line ~2923** - High spam score (≥80) triggers SMS when quarantined

No manual integration needed - it's already wired up!

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Rate Limiting
Prevent SMS spam with configurable limits:
```json
"rate_limiting": {
  "max_notifications_per_hour": 10,
  "cooldown_minutes": 5,
  "duplicate_suppression_minutes": 30
}
```

### Message Templates
Customize your alert messages:
```json
"message_templates": {
  "phishing_detected": "SECURITY ALERT: Phishing attempt blocked from {sender}",
  "bec_detected": "SECURITY ALERT: Business Email Compromise attempt from {sender}",
  "virus_detected": "SECURITY ALERT: Virus detected in email from {sender}",
  "daily_summary": "OpenEFA Daily Report: Processed {total}, Blocked {spam}, Threats {threats}, Quarantined {quarantined}"
}
```

### Notification Triggers
Enable/disable specific triggers:
```json
"triggers": {
  "phishing_detected": true,
  "bec_detected": true,
  "virus_detected": true,
  "high_spam_score": true
}
```

## 💰 Cost Management

- Each SMS uses 1 credit (~160 characters)
- Longer messages use multiple credits
- Monitor usage in ClickSend dashboard
- Rate limiting helps control costs
- Typical usage: ~5-15 SMS/day depending on email volume

## 📝 Monitoring & Logs

### View Notification History
```bash
# Check notification logs
tail -f /opt/spacyserver/logs/notifications.log

# Query database
mysql -u spacy_user -p spacy_email_db
SELECT * FROM notification_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;

# Check rate limiting status
SELECT * FROM notification_rate_limit;
```

### View Health Monitor Status
```bash
tail -f /opt/spacyserver/logs/health_monitor.log
```

## 🔒 Security

- Config file has 600 permissions (only root/spacy-filter can read)
- API credentials never logged
- Database password secured in Python code (change to match your setup)
- All SMS transmissions encrypted via ClickSend HTTPS API

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "ClickSend client not initialized"
- Verify credentials in `/opt/spacyserver/config/notification_config.json`
- Ensure `enabled` is set to `true`
- Check credentials are not placeholder values

### "API Error: Unauthorized"
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Check ClickSend account is active
- Regenerate API key if needed

### "SMS not received"
- Verify phone number includes country code (+1, etc.)
- Check ClickSend account has sufficient credits
- Check SMS delivery status in ClickSend dashboard
- Verify rate limits haven't been exceeded

### "Database connection failed"
- Update database password in `notification_service.py` line 75
- Update database password in `send_daily_notification_summary.py` line 24
- Change from `root` to `spacy_user` if needed
